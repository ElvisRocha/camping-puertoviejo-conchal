      "q": "Is it safe to camp in Costa Rica?",
      "a": "Absolutely! Costa Rica is one of the safest countries in Central America. Our camp has 24/7 security, and the local community is welcoming and friendly. Solo travelers, families, and groups all feel at home here."
    },
    "packing": {
      "q": "What should I bring?",
      "a": "Essentials: sunscreen, insect repellent, flashlight, water bottle, and adventure spirit. Nice to have: binoculars for wildlife, waterproof bag for beach days, light layers for cooler evenings. If you're renting a tent, we provide sleeping pads—just bring your own sleeping bag or rent bedding from us."
    },
    "weather": {
      "q": "What's the weather like?",
      "a": "Guanacaste has two seasons: dry (December-April) with sunny days and cool nights, and green (May-November) with afternoon showers and lush landscapes. Both are magical—dry season for guaranteed sun, green season for fewer crowds and dramatic skies."
    },
    "wildlifeSightings": {
      "q": "Can I see wildlife for sure?",
      "a": "While wildlife is wild (no guarantees in nature!), our location means sightings are extremely common. Howler monkeys are heard daily, birds are constant, and most guests see multiple species during their stay. Early mornings and late afternoons are prime time."
    },
    "families": {
      "q": "Is this good for families with kids?",
      "a": "Kids LOVE it here. The beach is calm for swimming, the wildlife is endlessly fascinating, and there's space to run and explore. We've hosted families with babies to teenagers—all leave with incredible memories."
    },
    "rain": {
      "q": "What if it rains?",
      "a": "Our tents are waterproof, and we have covered common areas. A tropical rain shower is part of the experience—usually short, dramatic, and followed by the freshest air you've ever breathed. Pack a light rain jacket and embrace it!"
    },
    "booking": {
      "q": "How do I book?",
